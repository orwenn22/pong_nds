# ROM Template (ARM9)

## 1. Introduction

This template contains code to build a project with custom ARM9 and the default
ARM7 provided by BlocksDS SDK.

Build it with the following command:

```bash
make
```

This should have generated a NDS ROM that you can run on any emulator or
flashcart.

To do a verbose build, run `make` like this (this also works for the Makefile
of the SDK):

```bash
VERBOSE=1 make
```

## 2. Makefile instructions

The paths in the Makefile that refer to source code, includes, graphics, data,
etc, must be inside the folder of the project. That means you can't use `..`
in a path to go one level up from the Makefile.

If you really need to use folders outside of the folder of the project, create a
symlink to the destination, or build the other code as a static library and link
it with the project.
